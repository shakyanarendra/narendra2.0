			       <h2><span style="color:563933">Van Vihar National Park is a national park in Bhopal, 
				   the capital city of Madhya Pradesh in central India. Declared a national park in 1979,
				   it covers an area of about 4.45 km2. It has the status of a national park, but is
				   developed and managed as a modern zoological park, following the guidelines of the Central
				   Zoo Authority. Animals are kept in near natural habitats. Most animals are either orphaned
				   and brought from various parts of the state or are exchanged from other zoos. No animal is
				   deliberately captured from the forest.[1] Van Vihar is unique because visitors access it 
				   from a road through the park, and trenches, walls, and chain-link fencing protect the animals 
				   from poachers while providing natural habitat.<span></h2>

						<h2> In the mid twentieth century a number of illegal stone quarries were operational
						in the area and, being in a serene and beautiful location on the bank of big lake, many
						commercial organizations were trying to take hold of this valuable piece of land. Realizing
						the importance of both in-situ and ex-situ conservation of wild fauna, it was decided to 
						provide this area with a legal umbrella under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. A committee 
						of experts was constituted to decide how to make Van Vihar a protected area. In 1983, on
						the committee's recommendation, the government declared an area of 4.4521 km2 a national park.
						Out of the 4.4521 km2 of land, an area 3.8839 km2 was government owned land and the rest 
						belonged to the villagers of Prempura, Dharampuri and Amkheda. Compensation of Rs. 23.52
						lakhs was paid to villagers to acquire 0.5692 km2 of private holdings. After the constitution
						of the National Park, the acquired area was enclosed in with stone walls and chain link fences.
						The first technical document known as the Management Plan to manage the Van Vihar was written
						in the year 2000 (for a period of 10 years from 2000 to 2010), by Jagdish Chandra, IFS, & 
						Ex-Director of Van Vihar. the area has now been transformed into 
						an oasis of greenery. The area today serves as the green lung for Bhopal City.</h2>

						Red fox, Indian jackal, wild dog, mongoose, striped hyena, mugger crocodile, gharial, and snakes
						such as the python are kept in captivity in a system of kraal and enclosures in lines of modern 
						concept of zoo management as per the norms of Central Zoo Authority. All felids and hyenas are 
						fed with buffalo meat, mutton and poultry. Bears are provided with milk, vegetables and fruits 
						to make a balanced diet</h2><br>

						 macaque, common langur are ranging freely. Normally the grass and other plant species growing
						 in Van Vihar are sufficient for these herbivores. However, in summer when the grass is scarce, 
						 green fodder produced in the fodder farm and wheat husk procured from the market is provided as
						 a supplement. In its ponds, Indian star tortoise, turtles, and a variety of fish occur. Van Vihar
						 also preserves animals belonging to endangered species.</h2><br>

                         The wilderness of park offers an ideal habitat for a number of avian fauna. Till now about two 
						 hundred species of birds have been listed in different parts of Van Vihar.[3] Large number of 
						 birds frequent this park, especially during winter the migratory waterfowl alight in great numbers
						 in the adjoining extensive wetland of big lake. In the 2010s, the park developed a vulture breeding
						 centre, which initially focused on restoring populations of white-rumped vulture (Gyps bengalensis),
						 and long billed vultures</h2>
